# AlJeEngine

The purpose of this project is to provide a basic introduction to game engine architecture - specifically the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture.

The engine is intentionally very simple and lacks many features necessary for a production engine. This is to retain as much clarity as possible, while still providing a functional engine.
